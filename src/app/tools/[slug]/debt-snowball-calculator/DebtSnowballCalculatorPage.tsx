        <h2>What Is the Debt Snowball Method?</h2>
        <p>
          The debt snowball method is a debt repayment strategy where you focus
          on paying off your smallest debts first while making minimum payments
          on larger debts. As each small debt is eliminated, you
          &ldquo;roll&rdquo; that payment into the next smallest debt, creating
          a &ldquo;snowball effect&rdquo; that builds momentum and motivation.
        </p>

          Popularized by financial expert Dave Ramsey, this{" "}
          <strong>debt snowball calculator</strong> helps you create a
          step-by-step plan to become debt-free. Unlike the debt avalanche
          method (which targets highest interest rates first), the snowball
          method prioritizes psychological wins to keep you motivated throughout
          your debt-free journey.

          month:

          <li>When each debt will be completely paid off</li>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

        <h3>Is the debt snowball method the fastest way to pay off debt?</h3>
        <p>
          The debt snowball method is typically not the fastest way to pay off
          debt mathematically—that would be the debt avalanche method. However,
          it&apos;s often the most effective in practice because it provides
          psychological motivation that helps people stick to their plan. A debt
          payoff plan you can actually follow is better than a mathematically
          optimal plan you abandon.
        </p>

        <h3>What happens if I have extra money to pay one month?</h3>
        <p>
          Any extra money should go directly toward your smallest debt (the one
          you&apos;re currently focusing on). This accelerates your timeline and
          gets you to your first &ldquo;win&rdquo; even faster. Never split
          extra payments among multiple debts—concentrate all extra payments on
          your target debt.
        </p>

        <h3>Should I include my mortgage in the debt snowball?</h3>
        <p>
          Most financial experts recommend focusing on consumer debt first
          (credit cards, personal loans, car payments) before tackling your
          mortgage. Your home typically appreciates in value and mortgage
          interest may be tax-deductible. Pay off high-interest consumer debt
          first, then consider extra mortgage payments.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I use the debt snowball method with student loans?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, student loans can be included in your debt snowball, especially
          private student loans with higher interest rates. However, consider
          the benefits of federal student loans (income-driven repayment plans,
          potential forgiveness programs) before aggressively paying them off.
          Private student loans are typically good candidates for the snowball
          method.
